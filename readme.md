## What to Look For in an Exchange

### Good Exchange Reputation

It is absolutely important that an exchange has as good repuation. You should do some research about an exchange you are considering signing up for. A good place to read personal experience with exchanges is reddit.

### Exchange Goals

The goals of an exchange are important. Exchanges strive to provide certain types of services for their users. Some goals are user data and funds security or simple and smooth interface. All goals have a cost for the end user.

### Security of Finances

No matter the exchange and what they have to offer, the security of your funds is important. Any exchange you plan to use should explicity show how they secure your funds and you should determine if that is secure enough. You can also do further reasearch about an exchanges security methods and if they are secure or not. A prime example is the Kraken exchange which has never had a major hack. They also promote and ensure that a user locks down their account.

### Deposit and Withdrawl Methods

The best deposit and withdrawl method is ACH (Automatic Clearing House) since it is usually doesn't have fees and is instant. Exchanges that use ACH typically set a delay of withdrawl on the deposited funds to prevent the cancelation of funds sent to the exchange.

### Account Security

It is important that an exchange promotes user account security and actively attempts to educate users about account security or motivate users to lock down their accounts.

### Currencies You Want to Trade

A big reason for the use of a specific exchange is because of the currencies they have to offer. So before creating an account with an exchange, you should make sure they facilitate the trading of the currencies you would like to trade.

## How to Create an Account

### Properly Secure the Account

You should secure your account to your maximum capability with whatever exchange you choose.  

Don't use 2FA over text; use a 2FA app. If possible, use a [security key](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/usb-security-key).

### Deposit and Funding Methods

Choose to use the ACH funding method.

### KYC Verification

All of the big exchanges that I have listed reqire KYC (Know Your Customer) verification. This can be seen as a privacy issue since it directly links your identity to any wallet you send a currency to from the exchange you use. Obviously there are ways of cleaning cryptocurrencies, which I don't advocate for, or way to avoid this issue by using non-KYC exchanges. 

Most exchanges have verifcation tiers which increase the capability of your account. Only verify to the tier that suites your needs.

# How to Create a Secure a Personal Wallet

## Types of Wallets

### Paper Wallets

A wallet where you write down the seed phrase and private key of a wallet after generating it offline.

### Hardware Wallets

A wallet with its keys stored on a device. This makes it so any access and usage of the wallet must be done with the device.

### Software Walets

A wallet where its seed phrase and private keys are stored on the computer the software is on to use the wallet.

### Web Wallets

A wallet where its seed phrase and private keys are stored on a website. This is typically a less secure method of storing cryptocurrency sincethe website owner may have access to the seed phrase and private key of the wallet.

### Mobile Wallets

Similar to software wallets but on a phone.

## Hardware Keys

### What Is a Hardware Key

A hardware key is a device that securely stores the seed phrases and private keys that allow for the full access of your individual wallets. This makes it easier to maintain access of all your wallets, but it also prevents the seed phrases and pivate key being stored on any other device.  

Some popular hardware keys are the [Ledger](https://shop.ledger.com/?r=a451624b7ece), [Trezor](https://trezor.io), and [Bitbox](https://shiftcrypto.ch).

Also, you will have to make sure the wallet is able to be used with your operating system.
